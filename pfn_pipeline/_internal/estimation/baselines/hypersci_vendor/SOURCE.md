# HyperSCI source provenance

Pinned commit: ba33ef07b16e2110faabd127bb510aed63e29ea1

model.py contains the HyperSCI class from Model.py, with imports narrowed,
utils made package-relative and the module device explicitly set to CPU.
The model class body is unchanged. Only the supported one-layer, n_out=0,
attention, skip=123 configuration is instantiated by our adapter.
utils.py contains pdist, wasserstein and get_hyperedge_attr from utils.py.
Small-sample guards: retain a two-dimensional group of size one instead of
squeeze(); cap dropout probability at .99 when n_treated*n_control <= 10.
For the N=1000 pilot these guards do not change the original computation.
The original Wasserstein estimator (including gradient behavior) is retained.
This is a pair-edge / majority-estimand adaptation, not a replication of the
paper's datasets, default hyperparameters, or evaluation protocol.
